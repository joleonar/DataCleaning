Course Data Cleaning coursera

I have created one script ("Project_01.R") for project of Data Clening Course, 
the script is separated y 5 parts, that does the following:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

En parts 4 and 5 additionally are created  two text files: "Tidy_DataS_1.txt" in part 4 and "Tidy_DataS_2.txt" in part 5.

"Tidy_DataS_1.txt":  is a text file with the training and test data merged with the mesurements of the mean 
and standard deviation of each measurement. Contain  10299 rows and   81 columns. 


"Tidy_DataS_2.txt": is a text file  with the average of the some variables for example
I take the mean of: "TimeBodyAcc-Mean-X","TimeBodyAcc-Mean-Y", "TimeBodyAcc-Mean-Z" and create a new variable called 
"TimeBodyAcc-Mean-XYZ.
